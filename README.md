1. How do I approach designing software?
  When designing software, I focus on user needs and system requirements, honing my skills in modular design and iterative development.
  My project's design process involved brainstorming, planning, prototyping, and refining, which I can apply to future projects by emphasizing flexibility and adaptability in my designs.

3. How do I approach developing programs?
  I approach developing programs with a clear plan and incremental improvements, using new strategies like modular coding and effective debugging.
  Iteration played a crucial role, allowing me to refine and enhance features continually. My approach has evolved to prioritize clear structure and thorough testing,
  ensuring robust and efficient code.
   
5. How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
   Computational graphics and visualizations have expanded my skill set, providing me with tools to create interactive and immersive experiences that are valuable for my educational
   and professional pathways. These skills enable me to tackle complex problems, visualize data effectively, and develop innovative solutions in various fields.
